## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price. 

r = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=STOCK_PARAMS)
r.raise_for_status()
stock_data = r.json()["Time Series (Daily)"]
formatted_stock_data = [val for (key, val) in stock_data.items()]
print(formatted_stock_data)

yesterday_price = float(formatted_stock_data[0]["4. close"])
print(yesterday_price)
day_before_yesterday_price = float(formatted_stock_data[1]["4. close"])
print(yesterday_price, day_before_yesterday_price)
stock_change = abs(yesterday_price - day_before_yesterday_price)
print(stock_change)
percent_change = stock_change/yesterday_price * 100
print(percent_change)

if percent_change > 5:
    print("Get News.")
else:
    print("Minor change.")


## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.

#        proxy_client = TwilioHttpClient()
#        proxy_client.session.proxies = {'https': os.environ['https_proxy']}
#        client = Client(account_sid, auth_token, http_client=proxy_client)

#        message = client.messages.create(
#            body="Bring an umbrella.",
#            from_="+18884877013",
#            to='+16306396125'
 #       )

#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
